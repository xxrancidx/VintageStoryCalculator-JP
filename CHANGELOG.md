## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added a dedicated no-account feedback page (`#feedback`) using reusable `src/components/feedback-form.svelte`, backed by Netlify Forms with a static detection form in `index.html` for SPA deployments
- Added a dedicated privacy page (`#privacy`) documenting feedback data processing, retention, and user rights

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added a direct link to the awesome Vintage Story Wiki!
- Added home-page component styles (`.hero`, `.tool-card`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, etc.) to `styles/components.css`

### Changed

- Redesigned home page (`src/routes/Home.svelte`) with a hero section, two tool cards, and a footer note, replacing the generic card-based layout
- Moved site navigation into the header, removing the standalone nav card from `<main>`
- Redesigned header with inline nav pills and a two-line brand block (name + tagline)
- Redesigned footer with a three-column grid (brand, calculators, project links)
- Rewrote `styles/layout.css` for the new header/nav/footer structure with updated responsive breakpoints
- Unified hash-route synchronization in `src/App.svelte` and reused `NAV_ITEMS` to render footer calculator links, reducing duplicated navigation logic
- Removed unused legacy home styles (`.feature-grid`, `.feature-card`) and dropped an empty script block from `src/routes/Home.svelte` to keep the redesign cleanup complete
- Redesigned both calculator routes into a left-rail and right-workspace layout with consistent shared card styling across controls and summaries
- Reworked stack-plan presentation in both calculators with section metrics, improved process-card hierarchy, denser stack chips, and stronger responsive behavior for large multi-process outputs
- Moved casting ore-source details into the left quick summary and removed the redundant casting metal-info card to keep the right workspace focused on plan output
- Extracted the shared stack-plan markup into `src/components/stack-plan-panel.svelte` and centralized whole-number formatting in `src/lib/numberFormatting.ts` to remove duplicated route logic
- Removed unused calculator selectors (`.status`, `#calculator .control-row`) from `styles/calculator.css` as part of the calculator layout cleanup

## [0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Settings modal with controls for theme, font family, UI scale, and help-text visibility
- `public/humans.txt` metadata file with author/site information

### Fixed

- Year reference in footer updated to 2026

### Changed

- Centralized UI preference handling in `src/stores/settings.ts` with localStorage persistence and legacy theme migration
- Help text rendering can now be toggled globally from settings
- App shell now initializes theme and settings together, and applies UI scale/font settings via CSS variables
- Simplified alloy output by removing the blend total status line and aligning process summaries with clearer step validity labels
- Simplified calculator surfaces with reduced gradients, stronger section borders, and updated navigation contrast
- Added hover help text on controls and process badges for clearer batch guidance

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- Removed unused DOM-based calculator class modules after migrating to store-driven rendering
- Consolidated calculator helpers for store-driven flows and removed unused helper paths
- Migrated calculator and theme state to Svelte stores with reactive outputs replacing DOM-driven updates
- Extracted alloy definitions to `src/data/alloys.json` for improved maintainability and reusability across components
- Updated `alloy_calculator.js` to dynamically load alloys from JSON instead of hardcoded definitions
- Updated `AlloyingCalculator.svelte` to use dynamically generated select options from JSON data
- Extracted metal definitions to `src/data/metals.json` for improved maintainability and reusability across components
- Updated `metal_calculator.js` and `CastingCalculator.svelte` to load metals from JSON data
- Centralized temperature formatting and game constants in `src/data/constants.json` and `src/lib/constants.ts`, with fuels split into `src/data/fuels.json`
- Migrated the codebase to TypeScript with strict settings, shared types, and ESLint TypeScript checks
- Added reusable Svelte input/card components with typed prop and event contracts, and refactored calculator pages to use them
- Moved casting/alloy allocation and process planning into `src/lib/smelting/` with explicit pure/alloy planning boundaries
- Updated alloy nugget allocation to find the smallest feasible ingot-step total that satisfies min/max constraints
- Updated process planning to support alloy constraints, balanced multi-process splits, and 20-nugget (100-unit) batch steps
- Added per-process metadata (`nuggetsTotal`, `unitsTotal`, `ingotsTotal`, `isIngotStepValid`) for clearer stack breakdown output
- Extracted shared stack/process display helpers to `src/lib/stack-display.ts` to keep calculator routes focused on UI binding
